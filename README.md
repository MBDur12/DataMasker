# DataMasker
DataMasker is a utility for masking sensitive data in JSON files. It reads in a list of regular expression patterns and uses them to replace key-value pairs in a JSON file with asterisks.

## Assumptions
DataMasker assumes that the input JSON file is clean and well-formatted. It will not handle parsing errors or malformed JSON.

## Limitations
DataMasker is a relatively simple utility and has not been extensively tested. With more time, further testing and refactoring could be done to improve its reliability and robustness.
